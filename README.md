# Deadcore_AutoSplitter
Autos-splitter for the game Deadcore


You need to put your livesplit to compare against Game Time.
The Autosplitter will auto start and auto split.
It will not pause the timer properly at the end of the level but will do so at the start of the level and correct itself before splitting.
So you will have to go into the epilogue of the game to have your last split.


Still work in progress.
Does not work for SpeedrunMode.
